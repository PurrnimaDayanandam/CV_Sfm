"# SfM-GMS" 

We plan to implement three techniques in this project: Structure from Motion (SfM) and optimized feature match using Grid-based Motion Statistics (GMS) and Local geometric support for high outlier spatial verification (LOGOs). SfM is a technique using a sequence of 2D images to reconstruct 3D models. SfM utilizes SIFT aor similar feature match techniques, but these techniques are not good at handling noise. In this project we plan to use GMS which provide a more robust feature correspondences. Also, we plan to compare the results of GMS with LOGOs feature matching algorithm.
